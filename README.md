## TRACKING WEATHER, LOCATIONS, AND DESTINATIONS USING API QUERIES


# OVERVIEW

In this project, I was asked to access an API, then to track the weather data and potential vacation destinations based on the data tracked by that API.
Using matplotlib and hvplot, I also visualized the data with scatterplots and map plots.


#Note About VacationPy.ipynb
In the last two cells of this Jupyter Notebook, I was asked to find hotels in cities that fit a particular weather criterion, then to plot them on a map plot.
These cells unfortunately show no suitable hotels. This may be because there are no hotels in cities that fit this criterion, but it seems likely that the
API query includes an error. I will attempt to adjust and resubmit the code at a later date.
