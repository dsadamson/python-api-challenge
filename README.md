## TRACKING WEATHER, LOCATIONS, AND DESTINATIONS USING API QUERIES


# OVERVIEW

In this project, I was asked to access an API, then to track the weather data and potential vacation destinations based on the data tracked by that API.
Using matplotlib and hvplot, I also visualized the data with scatterplots and map plots.


# Features

For this project, I generated two API keys: one for the Open Weather Map API and another for Geoapifiy. Moreover, I used the following imports to parse and visualize the API data:

    import hvplot.pandas
    import pandas as pd
    import requests
    import holoviews as hv
    from colorcet import fire
    import matplotlib as plt
    import numpy as np
    import time
    from scipy.stats import linregress
    from citipy import citipy

These imports and the API keys are loaded at the start of each Jupyter Notebook.
